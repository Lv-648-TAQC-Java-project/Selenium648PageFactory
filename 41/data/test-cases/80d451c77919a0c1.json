There are several churches within the complex, while a part of the monastery serves as a museum, where you can find many architectural relics of the past.Locally known as Maidan Nezalezhnosti, this square has been in the center of many important events in the modern history of Ukraine. The most recognizable monument on the square is the so-called Independence Monument, a 200ft tall victory column placed in the center of the square.\nOn the top of the column stands a bronze figurine of a woman holding a rose branch. Since the beginning of the Ukrainian independence movement, this square has been used for political rallies and protests. Nowadays, the square hosts a number of cultural events, and is a place where many city tours begin.In the city of churches, the Golden Gate of Kiev strikes as a rather odd structure. Currently used as a museum, this was the main gate to the fortification of Kiev in the 11th century.The original structure was nearly completely dismantled, and only few vestiges remain. The rest was rebuilt in 1982 based on a speculation , since nobody knows how the originalfd. With its numerous parks and gardens, Kiev is perfect for picnics and outdoor activities.\nHidropark is an island in the Dnieper River whose natural beaches are very popular during the summer. Besides swimming, you can also play beach volleyball, eat delicious street food or simply sunbathe.]" ]
